    <h2 class="blogh2">Three things you should do during the covid-19 outbreak</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">Coronavirus Or COVID-19 is the main concern for people of all ages across the globe today. It spreads mainly from being in close contact- within about 6 feet- for a prolonged period. The disease is spent when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms- asymptomatic- likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Each surface or object has the opportunity to spread the disease- traces of the virus can be transferred from there and enter a new person if they happen to touch their own mouth, nose, or eyes. COVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sunlight, humidity, and the type of surface. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>

    <img style="margin:5rem auto; width:90%;" src="https://anand-sinha.github.io/OxyShield/img/blog8_1.jpg" alt="">

    <p style="text-align:justify;">Since the main goal for prevention is to avoid contact, <strong>social distancing</strong> is the first step to take in combating the disease. It is a ‘non-pharmaceutical’ step to ensure the decrease in spread of the disease. Social distancing can aid in the slowing down- and eventual stopping- of the transmission of coronavirus. If carried out effectively, it can lead to a decrease in spread, morbidity and mortality of the disease. </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Essentially, social distancing is a means to limit the opportunity for the virus to spread from contaminated objects, surfaces and people. Two main ways to implement this practice are- avoiding any gatherings that ask for close contact with people, and maintaining a minimum of 6 feet distance from other individuals when carrying out essential activities like grocery shopping. .</p>

  <img style="margin:5rem auto; width:90%;" src="https://anand-sinha.github.io/OxyShield/img/blog8_2.jpg" alt="">

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Another essential precaution to be taken is <strong>facemasks.</strong> When in public spaces, keeping a cloth face mask on- especially in grocery stores- is imperative in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Some rules apply to the use of the facemasks as well- they should not be used for children under the age of 2, anyone with breathing issues, those that are unconscious or incapicated and unable to remove the mask by themself. They should also not be used when one is doing physical exercise.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Facemasks are a measure to protect those around you when you yourself are infected. Multi-layered masks are better at preventing the spread of the disease. However, one must remember that face masks are NOT a substitute for social distancing and should be used in tandem with it. </p>

  <img style="margin:5rem auto; width:90%;" src="https://anand-sinha.github.io/OxyShield/img/blog8_3.jpg" alt="">

  <p style="text-align:justify;">A third and basic step of prevention of transmission of COVID-19 is the use of <strong>sanitizers and sanitizing agents</strong> for frequently used surfaces. For surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, phones, sinks and so on, regular cleaning should be followed by household disinfectants- most of which are effective in treating contaminants. Regular washing and sanitisation of hands is imperative in order to make sure the body is also undergoing regular detoxification. The facemasks one uses should also be washed with regularity- preventing both external and internal communication of the disease. </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 5rem;">The risks of COVID-19 are different for each demographic but no less harmful. Since the disease can spread between anyone and everyone, each person in a community has their own role to play in the prevention of the spread of the disease. The above steps are just some basic measures to help curb that growth in your family, community, and in the global space. </p>
